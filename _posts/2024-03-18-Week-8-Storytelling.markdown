San Francisco, famously known for its iconic Golden Gate Bridge, diverse culture, and vibrant neighborhoods, also grapples with the challenge of crime, specially auto theft. To uncover trends over the years,  we delve into the San Francisco Police Dataset spanning from 2003 to 2017. By analyzing this rich dataset, we aim to shed light on how crime patterns have evolved in the city over the past decade and a half. The dataset provides a comprenhensive record of reported incidents within the city, including information such as the type of crime, geographical location, date and time. 

San Francisco. The city has installed 68 CCTV recording cameras since 2005. The San
Francisco Chronicle reported that, as of March 2008, the city had spent $900,000 and
had budgeted an additional $200,000 for 25 more cameras to target both violent gang
activity and property crime. An study also found that San Francisco’s cameras had “no effect” on violent
crimes.

Vehicle Thefts are not violent crimes, so the presence of cameras can discourage people from comitting the crime and therefore reducing the crimes.
