The prevalence of common mental disorders is increasing among the populations of Western developed nations (1). Notably, Depressive Disorder (DD) stands out as one of the most significant mental health challenges. 
While mental illnesses are treatable, accurately estimating their prevalence and understanding their potential associations with other factors remains challenging. To address this, it is crucial to collect reliable data and analyze it effectively to comprehend these conditionsâ€”examining how, when, and why they occur, as well as the number of people affected by them.
With this project, we aim to study a series of datasets encompassing the prevalence of various mental health disorders globally and across different years, with a special focus on DD, and other related information. More specifically, we seek to study the relationship between DD with other factors, such as Alcohol or Drug disorders, or Suicide Rates, both globally and in greater detail within those countries where DD is a significant problem.


In order to gain an overall understanding of the depression prevalence worldwide, we have developed an interactive bar chart plot that serves as a dynamic tool to explore and visualize the prevalence of depression annually from 1990 to 2017. Figure 1 allows users to select a specific year and highlights countries with both the highest and lowest depression prevalence. Notably, Greenland consistently stands out with the highest prevalence.
