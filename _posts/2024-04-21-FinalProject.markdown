The prevalence of common mental disorders is increasing among the populations of Western developed nations (1). Notably, Depressive Disorder (DD) stands out as one of the most significant mental health challenges. 
While mental illnesses are treatable, accurately estimating their prevalence and understanding their potential associations with other factors remains challenging. To address this, it is crucial to collect reliable data and analyze it effectively to comprehend these conditions—examining how, when, and why they occur, as well as the number of people affected by them.
With this project, we aim to study a series of datasets encompassing the prevalence of various mental health disorders globally and across different years, with a special focus on DD, and other related information. More specifically, we seek to study the relationship between DD with other factors, such as Alcohol or Drug disorders, or Suicide Rates, both globally and in greater detail within those countries where DD is a significant problem.

In order to gain a broader vision of the distribution of depression prevalence globally, we developed an interactive bar chart plot that serves as a dynamic tool to explore and visualize the prevalence of depression annually from 1990 to 2017. This plot allows users to select a specific year and highlights countries with both the highest and lowest depression prevalence. Notably, Greenland consistently stands out with the highest prevalence.

According to Figure 3, the Tenderloin district consistently emerges as the safest area with regards to vehicle theft, which as discussed before, showed the biggest reduction in reported auto thefts after the CCTV installation in 2005. This observation may seem unexpected, considering the reputation of the Tenderloin district among others in the center such as Mission, for its prevalence of crimes, which may be mainly by violent crimes. On the other hand, the Ingleside district generally exhibits the highest ratio of vehicle thefts, positioning it as one of the least secure areas in this regard, probably due to its proximity to access points to major highways. However, it is important to point out that, following a rise in vehicle thefts starting in 2011, Ingleside reached its peak in 2014 before declining gradually.

It is indeed noteworthy that the number of vehicle thefts peaked in 2015 across several districts, including Mission and Northern. We propose that this surge may be linked to justice reforms. Specifically, in November 2014, Proposition 47 was introduced, which downgraded certain nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors [3]. However, this change sparked controversy, and definitive conclusions regarding the impact of justice reforms on crime rates remain elusive.

In conclusion, our analysis of the San Francisco Police Dataset revealed intriguing insights into the impact of CCTV installation on vehicle theft rates in the city. Despite initial concerns and opposition, manifesting the inefficacy of this system, the beginning of the installation of CCTV cameras coincided with a noticeable reduction in reported vehicle thefts, suggesting a potential deterrent effect on non-violent crimes such as these. Our analysis, based on geolocated data, suggests that the installation of the CCTV had a big impact from 2005 to 2006 in districts such as Tenderloin or Park, which are known for having a high affluence of vehicles, and thus, targets for this type of crimes.

Furthermore, the multi-line interactive graph in Figure 3 illustrates how the introduction of CCTV contributed to reduce the number of vehicle thefts across different districts over time. Tenderloin district exhibits the most significant decline in thefts post-CCTV installation. However, challenges remain, as evidenced by fluctuations in theft rates observed post-2010 and the persistent high incidence in districts like Ingleside. This underscores the need for continued evaluation and adaptation of surveillance strategies alongside complementary crime prevention measures to ensure sustained improvements in public safety throughout San Francisco.
