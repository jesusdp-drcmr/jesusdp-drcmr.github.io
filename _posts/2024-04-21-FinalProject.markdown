The prevalence of common mental disorders, particularly Depressive Disorder (DD), is escalating across developed nations, presenting a significant and growing challenge to public health. 

In particular, Greenland has undergone significant social and political transformations since World War II. This has caused profound changes within the Greenland society, impacting the populationâ€™s mental health, with DD emerging as a prominent concern.

requiring comprenhensive and targeted research to improve health interventions.

While this condition treatable, accurately estimating its prevalence and understanding its trends and potential associations with other factors remains challenging. To address this, it is crucial to conduct targeted research by collect reliable data and analyze it effectively.

What factors might contribute to the prevalence of depression in the case of Greenland? How does it distribute across the population? Are there any discernible trends or patterns that can shed light on the unique challenges and dynamics of DD prevalence in Greenland? By using data visualization techniques, we seek to explore the DD prevalence in Greenland, compare with other countries, identifying trends, patterns, and potential contributing factors.

To set the stage for our analysis on Greenland's data, we begin by providing a snapshot of the global landscape of depression prevalence through an interactive bar chart plot (Figure 1). This intuitive tool enables users to explore the annual prevalence of depression globally from 1990 to 2017, spotlighting countries with both the highest and lowest rates.

As it can be unfolded, Greenland consistently stands out with the highest depression prevalence rates. By 2017, its DD prevalence reached 6.55%, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Are there any differences regarding the distribution of DD prevalence across Greenlandic population? A study carried out in 2014 by the World Health Organization highlighted gender-specific trends within Greenland. This survey revealed that girls in Greenland reported elevated levels of depression, nervousness, and sleep difficulties compared to boys.

As depicted in Figure 3, the prevalence of depression among females has consistently been approximately twice as high as among males. However, recent data indicates a promising trend of decreasing the prevalence, suggesting potential improvements in interventions targeting the female population in Greenland.

Another significant finding from the 2014 survey underscores the heightened vulnerability of younger individuals in Greenland. They were identified as the most susceptible group, facing increased risks associated with depression, substance abuse, and suicidal tendencies. Remarkably, this pattern persists in the data from subsequent years, as evidenced by Figure 4, which delineates the prevalence of depression across different age groups in Greenland for the year 2017. As depicted, the highest prevalence rate continues to be associated with the population aged between 20-24 years, reaffirming the enduring nature of this concerning trend.

Could high rates of substance consumption contribute to elevated depression and suicide rates in Greenland? A prevailing hypothesis suggests that high rates of substance consumption might indeed play a role. With this hypothesis as our guide, we aim to uncover trends in alcohol and drug consumption in Greenland that could potentially correlate alcohol and drug disorders with the prevalence of depression and suicide rates.

Figure 5 reveals striking trends in the prevalence of alcohol and drug disorders in Greenland compared to the average rates observed in various European countries over the last decades. Given these observed patterns, it becomes increasingly plausible to suggest a potential correlation between these elevated rates of alcohol and drug disorders and the rates of depression and suicide in Greenland.
